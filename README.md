# Final Project - Build a Responsive Website

## My Stranger Things Website
This website is dedicated to the Netflix original series Stranger Things.  The site has several pages showing characters,
merchandise and trailers to the seasons. There are other things I'm testing so the code may still be visible but I've commented
it out since it's not yet being used.

### Additional Information
- Wayfinding feature used to show which page is currently being viewed/active.
- Hamburger button built for navigation on small screens, it's hidden on larger screens.
- Demogorgon image in upper right corner will take you back to the home page if you click on it.
- Home page image will change to a different image when it's viewed on mobile screens.

# Character Page
- Hover used for zoom in/out on image for each character.
- Character page using Flexbox to display images and they adjust as screen gets smaller.

## Merchandise Page
- Merch table will hide details column and data on mobile screens.
- Merch page using "nth-of-type" to change row colors in table.

### Login Form
- Added login form (login.html) with code validation for length of password and email info.
- Error messages will be displayed and inform you when info isn't valid.
- If you leave fields blank you'll receive an error message stating fields are mandatory.
- I also added the login button to all pages and cancel button to the form itself which takes users back to home page.

- SIGN-UP form also has validation for email address (emails must have .com) and length of password (must be >8 characters).
    - Once you signup successfully, you'll be redirected to login page.
    
- LOGIN form has validation code for length of password.
    - Once you login successfully, you'll be redirected to the home page.
